**[See it live](https://txcsmad.github.io/js-color-clock)**. Needs Chrome 48 or higher.

## What is it?

Digital clock that changes color each second according to the hex color code of the current time. 

For example: the time `12:00:34 PM` corresponds to the hex code `#120034`, which is a dark shade of blue as shown in the screen shot.

The code:

- uses ES6 classes and arrow functions
- is simple and readable
- is modular and pays attention to some minor performance improvements
